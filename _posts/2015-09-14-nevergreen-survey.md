# Nevergreen survey

## Why?

We currently don't have much visibility of how Nevergreen is being used in the wild. We've put together a short survey 
with some simple questions that should take no more than a few minutes to complete. By completing this simple survey we 
will gain valuable insights that will allow us to better prioritise new features and fixes going forward.

## How?

The survey is available as a Google Form and does not require any form of login to complete.

[Take the Nevergreen survey](http://goo.gl/forms/R6NRjSPcE9).

## Anything else?

Please share this post and survey with anyone else you know using Nevergreen, as the more people who take the survey the
more indicative the results will be.

You can also directly comment on current issues and raise feature requests on the 
[Nevergreen GitHub issues page](https://github.com/build-canaries/nevergreen/issues).
