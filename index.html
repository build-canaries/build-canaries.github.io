<p><strong>Noun</strong><br>
canary in a coal mine</p>

<p>(idiomatic) Something whose sensitivity to adverse conditions makes it a useful early indicator of such conditions; something which warns of the coming of greater danger or trouble by a deterioration in its health or welfare.</p>

<h2>
<a id="what" class="anchor" href="#what" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What?</h2>

<p>The idea of build monitors is not new, but building your own takes time and focus away from building the actual software you want to build.</p>

<h2>
<a id="how" class="anchor" href="#how" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How?</h2>

<p>Primarily we have created a build monitor, <a href="http://nevergreen.io/">Nevergreen</a>, that we believe can be used by most projects "out of the box". For the times this is not the case, the entire codebase of Nevergreen is open source allowing it to be improved or completely modified by anyone in the community. We have also extracted several libraries out of the Nevergreen source allowing them to be used directly, for completely new and different monitor ideas.</p>

<h2>
<a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Â Why?</h2>

<p>As teams and projects get bigger and more complicated, there are more chances for build and integration failures. The earlier and clearer these failures are presented to the teams involved the better.
